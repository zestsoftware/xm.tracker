Changelog for xm.tracker
========================

0.3 (unreleased)
----------------

- Show the total hours booked today (real xm bookings) as a tooltip on
  the timer.  [maurits+simon]

- Do not store the portal_url in the task_url; copying a Data.fs from
  production to a development machine would give you a url to the
  tasks on the production site, which is not handy and can be
  dangerous.  After this change you need to remove existing tracker
  tasks and add them again unfortunately.  [maurits+simon]

- Bug fix: when the tracker pointed to a task with a Discussion Item
  (comment) in it you would get: 'TypeError: a float is required'.
  [maurits]


0.2 (2008-09-17)
----------------

- Bug fix: a booking for 75 minutes would get stored as 1 hour and
  75 minutes instead of 1 hour and 15 minutes.  [maurits]


0.1.1 (2008-09-16)
------------------

- Removed egenix-mx-base from the install_requires of setup.py as it
  is not easy_installable.  Improved docs/INSTALL.txt to explain about
  how to install mx.DateTime.  [maurits]


0.1 (2008-09-16)
----------------

- First version. [maurits, reinout, jladage, simon]
