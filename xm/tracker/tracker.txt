Tracker
=======

A tracker should not be viewable by an anonymous user.  This is
because the tracker is designed to track time for a logged in user::

  >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
  >>> from zope.annotation.interfaces import IAttributeAnnotatable
  >>> from zope.interface import classImplements
  >>> classImplements(TestRequest, IAttributeAnnotatable)
  >>> from xm.tracker.browser.tracker import TrackerView
  >>> tracker_view = TrackerView(self.portal, TestRequest())
  >>> print tracker_view()
