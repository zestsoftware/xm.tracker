* When an entry with empty text is tracked, an error is raised, but
  the timer is still reset, at least in the browser.  Refreshing the
  page restores the real time again.  Possible solutions:

  - Somehow cancel the timer-reset event.

  - Refresh the entire page.

  - Prevent entering text when the track button is disabled.
